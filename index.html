            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Primordial Rebels is a creative project that is inspired by Nietzsche's Will to Power. This project has emerged based on some fundamental philosophical positions and assertions.</p>
            <p>1. <b>Authenticity</b> - The meaning of life is to become who you are.</p>
            <p>2. <b>Perspectivism</b> – There is no universal truth, only competing perspectives.</p>
            <p>3. <b>Will to Power</b> – Strong moral systems arise from healthy drives for assertion, growth, overcoming, happiness, etc.</p>
            <p>4. <b>Nihilism</b> - Psychological poverty should not be suppressed or avoided! Nihilism and suffering are not evil, it is sometimes <b>necessary</b>.</p>
            <p>5. <b>God</b> - God is a linguistic phenomenon that represents a person or culture's highest ideals. It is experienced as true and real, but it is a psychological experience that was created by the Will to Power. Gods are a way to inspire the greatest ambitions of an individual, and by extent, the collective. Traditional gods are no longer tenable for many, and this is not a personal failing, but a cultural one.</p>
            <p>4. Truth is found in what enhances your personal strength and vitality.</p>

            <h2>The Problems</h2>
            <p>1. <b>The War Against Subjective Experience</b> - We live in a world that is at war with the healthy, vital and the strong. The strong are today considered immoral. We creators, thinkers, doers and free spirits. We who attempt to innovate culture.. We who stand for the present and future, over the past.. We who embody a rebellious spirit, rather than submissive one, may always be demonized. Perhaps it is our fate.. Or perhaps, it is our wish!</p>
            <p>2. <b>Objective Atheism & Nihilism</b> - In modernity, man thinks himself atheist and objective, but what good is pure objectivity? What sort of vitality does science provide? Why does man calmly applaud his own reduction to insignificance? Science is not bad, but what might the implications be of allowing external truths to govern internal experiences? While there is certainly an opportunity presented by atheism, it has pitfalls too. The pitfall however, is not that an atheist is not religious, its the extent to which an atheist may find themselves <b>reactionary</b> and reliant on external truths.</p>
            <p>3. <b>Alienation</b> - Modern religious institutions have become alienating, even for many religious people. It's time to blaze a new trail forward, rather than trying to dress Christianity up as some fundamental truth.</p>

            <h1>The Primordial Beings</h1>
            <p>A primordial being represents a pattern that any human can experience. All human drives emerge from the Will to Power. Modern society has demonized many healthy instincts as immoral or sinful, leading to repression and an inward-turning will that produces guilt and shame instead of overcoming. Perhaps the most destructive invention of the past 2,000 years is the idea of sin. By recognizing the drives within oneself and understanding them not as strictly good or evil, but as expressions of the Will to Power, one can better affirm their own existence and the full expression of life.</p>
            <p>Do you hear me? Every drive has a <b>purpose</b>, and it is up to you to decide where it should be aimed.</p>
