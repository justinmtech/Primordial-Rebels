            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Primordial Rebels is a creative project that is inspired by Nietzsche's Will to Power. This project has emerged based on some fundamental philosophical positions and assertions.</p>
            <p>1. <b>Authenticity</b> - The meaning of life is to become who you are.</p>
            <p>2. <b>Perspectivism</b> – There is no universal truth, only competing perspectives.</p>
            <p>3. <b>Will to Power</b> – Strong moral and narrative systems arise from healthy drives for assertion, growth, overcoming, happiness, etc.</p>
            <p>4. <b>Nihilism</b> - Psychological poverty should not be suppressed or avoided! Nihilism and suffering are not evil, it is sometimes <b>necessary</b>.</p>
            <p>5. <b>God</b> - Gods are a linguistic and psychological phenomenon that represent a person or culture's highest ideals. It is experienced as true and real, but it is a psychological experience that was created by the willpower of a people. Gods are a way to inspire the greatest ambitions of an individual, and by extent, a group.</p>
            <p>6. Truth is found in what enhances your personal strength and vitality.</p>

        <section id="problems">
            <h2>The Problems</h2>
            <p>1. <b>Dead Spirits</b> - Christianity is based on collective experiences that were perhaps fulfilling in the past, but not anymore. New, more natural ways of life are necessary.</p>
            <p>2. <b>Objective Atheism & Nihilism</b> - Objective Atheism is ultimately a scientific and cold worldview. It has its purposes, but not for people who have a rich, artistic perspective of the world. It is a community built on simply a lack of a belief, rather than any greater uniting principles.</p>
            <p>3. <b>Alienation</b> - Modern religious institutions are alienating for free spirits, and even for many religious people. It's time to blaze a new cultural trail forward, rather than latching on even more vehemently to the past.</p>
            <p>4. <b>Dogmatism</b> - Rigid dogmatism is perhaps the primary reason for the downfall of prevailing religious worldviews.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="solution">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>1. <b>Creating Living Spirits</b> - We are writing new literature that is more philosophically and experientially aligned with how daily life is experienced.</p>
            <p>2. <b>Embracing Subjectivism</b> - Literary creativity is something every resilient culture has been built around. These texts are not objective truths, but rather reflections of the people who upheld them.</p>
            <p>3. <b>Re-Enchanting Your Worldview</b> - Not only do we seek to provide new ways of looking at and engaging with your psyche and the world, we encourage people to learn the skill of personal myth-making.</p>
            <p>4. <b>Rituals</b> - People have lost the value of rituals! We provide some rituals that you may enjoy partaking in, while also showing you how to make your own.</p>

            <h1>The Primordial Beings</h1>
            <p>A primordial being represents a pattern that any human can experience. By recognizing the drives within oneself and understanding them not as strictly good or evil, but as expressions of the Will to Power, one can better affirm their relationship with inner-drives, and external life.</p>
            <p>Do you hear me? Every drive has a <b>purpose</b>, and it is up to you to decide where it should be aimed.</p>
